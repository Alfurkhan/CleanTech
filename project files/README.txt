# CleanTech: AI-Powered Waste Management with Transfer Learning

## Project Overview

CleanTech is an innovative AI-powered waste management solution that leverages deep learning to classify waste into three primary categories: Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash. The system uses VGG16 transfer learning to provide accurate, real-time waste classification through an intuitive web interface.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Classification**: VGG16-based deep learning model for accurate waste categorization
- **Real-Time Processing**: Instant image analysis and classification results
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Responsive web application with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed probability breakdown for each classification
- **Educational Content**: Disposal recommendations and environmental tips
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
